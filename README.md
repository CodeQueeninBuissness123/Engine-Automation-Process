# Engine-Automation-Process
A Python project that demonstrates how to use OOP to create an engine automation process. It models the engine, fuel pump, ignition system, and automation process with 4 classes. The process starts the engine, pumps fuel for 10 iterations, and stops the engine. Good for learning OOP and automation.
