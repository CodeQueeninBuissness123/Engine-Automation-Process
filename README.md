# Engine-Automation-Process
A Python project that demonstrates how to use OOP to create an engine automation process. It models the engine, fuel pump, ignition system, and automation process with 4 classes. The process starts the engine, pumps fuel for 10 iterations, and stops the engine. Good for learning OOP and automation.


Engine Automation Process
This is a Python project that demonstrates how to create an engine automation process using object-oriented programming. It consists of four classes that model the engine, fuel pump, ignition system, and automation process. The automation process starts the engine, pumps fuel for 10 iterations, and stops the engine. It's a good example of how to use Python classes and objects to model a real-world system and automate a process.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/engine-automation-process.git
Prerequisites
This project requires Python 3.

Usage
To use the project, navigate to the project directory and run the main.py file:

arduino
Copy code
cd engine-automation-process
python main.py
This will output the entire automation process, including the fuel tank filling, ignition on, engine start, fuel pumping, engine stop, and ignition off.
